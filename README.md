Advent of Code 2018, in Go

To run a day:

```shell
go run ./cmd/day01
```

### Why 2018?

ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I try and do the live one every year but after a certain point it takes longer to do the day's puzzle than I have free time available in a day so I give up and just do them later.

I've not done 2018 yet so seemed a good one.

### Why Go?

I like it, and I've written a load of libraries that, whilst not intended to help me solve Advent of Code puzzles, do a pretty good job of helping me solve them
